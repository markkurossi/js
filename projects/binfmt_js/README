			      =========

This is the Linux `binfmt_js' module to execute JS byte-code files
natively on Linux.  This module is developed by Dmitry M. Golubovsky
<golubovsky@usa.net> from the Linux binfmt_java module.

The package contains the following files:

  Makefile	Makefile for standalone compilation.
  README	This file.
  binfmt_js.c	The source code for the module.
  binfmt_js.o	A pre-compiled module.

The installation of the module depends on you Linux distribution.
Dmitry said that he managed to get it work by editing
`/etc/rc.d/rc.modules' file on his Slackware system.

I got things running with the following steps on Redhat-5.1/i386:

  - copy binfmt_js.o to `/lib/modules/preferred/fs/binfmt_js.o'
  - add "alias binfmt-448 binfmt_js" to `/etc/conf.modules' file
  - run command "depmod -a preferred" as root
  - install the `js' executable to `/usr/local/bin/js':

    $ cd js
    $ make
    $ make install

After these steps, the system works smoothly:

  $ echo 'System.stdout.writeln ("Hello, world!");' >hello.js
  $ js -c hello.js
  $ chmod a+x hello.jsc
  $ ./hello.jsc
  Hello, world!
